md" In this session we will be looking at the normal distribution in detail. This distribution features in many places in Bayesian econometrics and it is quite important to understand some of its properties.  We will then move on to a discussion of marginalisation and look at the normal distribution with different types of priors. This lecture almost serves as a reminder of why we don't want to work with analytical distributions, we would much rather perform computational exercises. 

In this session we use some mathematics and theorethical constructs. Make sure you follow the logic. The math is not particularly difficult, you should have all the necesarry tools. If you are struggling with any part, please let me know.  "

md" Before we start with the Normal distribution and marginalisation, let us quickly discuss Monte Carlo methods, since we will be using them throughout the rest of the course. According to Wikipedia, Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.  Our first Monte Carlo example will be to try and estimate the value for $\pi$.

In this section we will have some fun trying to approximate $\pi$ using Monte Carlo methods. We will compare the speed of computation between Julia and R for this example. The purpose of this section is twofold. First, to establish a motivation for the use of simulation techniques. Second, to encourage some general problem solving through coding. Think about what this program is doing and see whether it makes sense to you. The code is easy enough to understand, it is the underlying logic that might be tricky.

This is a distribution that we will be dealing with a lot in the course, so it is worthwhile getting used to its functional form and different properties. It appears almost everywhere! 

The central limit theorem helps justify our usage of the normal distribution. Important authors responsible for development of this theorem include De Moivre, Laplace, Gauss, Chebysev, Liapounov and Markov. Given certain conditions the sum (and mean) of independent random variables approach a Gaussian distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$ even if original variables are not normally distributed.

There are some problems

1. It does not hold for all distributions, e.g., Cauchy
2. This may require very large values of $n$. See the case of Binomial, when $\theta$ close to $0$ or $1$

The first thing that we will do is derive the posterior distribution for the mean in the Gaussian model. We will start with the single parameter case, so we will assume that the variance $\sigma^{2}$ is known. This is rarely true in practice, so we will then move on to a discussion where both parameters are unknown.

# ╔═╡ 8ffaa0dc-36f8-49da-9742-74db90c6d5a8
md""" 

**Note**: As we have mentioned, we start with a single parameter model. The parameter of interest for this model is the mean, which we will refer to as $\theta$. We could have named it $\mu$, but that can create confusion as to whether the quantity is known or not. We know $\sigma^{2}$ but are looking for information on $\theta$ so that we can build our posterior, $p(\theta \mid y)$. In other books you might see the same calculations, but with $\mu$ instead of $\theta$. We will only do this for the first example, so that you can get comfortable with the math. 

To illustrate the basic mechanics of Bayesian analysis, we start with a toy example. Suppose we take $N$ independent measurements $y_{1}, \ldots, y_{N}$ of an unknown quantity $\theta$, where the magnitude of measurement error is known. In addition, from a small pilot study $\theta$ is estimated to be about $\mu_{0}$. In other words, we have some information to help us decide on a prior for $\theta$. 

Our goal is to obtain the posterior distribution $p(\theta \mid {y})$ given the sample ${y}=$ $\left(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{N}\right)^{\prime} .$ To that end, we need two ingredients: a likelihood function and a prior for the parameter $\theta$.

One simple model for this measurement problem is the normal model:

$$\left(y_{n} \mid \theta \right) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\theta, \sigma^{2}\right), \quad n=1, \ldots, N$$

where the variance $\sigma^{2}$ is **assumed to be known**. Then, the model defines the likelihood function $p({y} \mid \theta)$. 

Since the scale of the study is small, there is uncertainty around the estimate. A reasonable prior would be

$$\theta \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_{0}, \tau_{0}^{2}\right)$$

where both $\mu_{0}$ and $\tau_{0}^{2}$ are known. **Note**: this is a distribution around our unknown parameter $\theta$. Our prior distribution is Normal with these specific parameters. 

Relevant information about $\theta$ is summarized by posterior distribution, which can be obtained by Bayes' theorem:

$$p(\theta \mid {y})=\frac{p(\theta) p({y} \mid \theta)}{p({y})}$$

It turns out that $p(\theta \mid y)$ is a Gaussian distribution. We will now try and show this. The derivation can get a bit messy, but the logic is important. If you have done mathematical statistics at any stage you will feel right at home! 😉

#### Derivation (NB for Exam)

"""

We need a prior and likelihood function to produce the posterior distribution. 

We start with the form of the likelihood function $p(y \mid {\theta})$. 

Recall from our first lecture that we say a random variable $X$ follows a normal or Gaussian distribution, and we write $X \sim \mathcal{N}\left(a, b^{2}\right)$, its density is given by

$$f_{X}\left(X = x ; a, b^{2}\right)=\left(2 \pi b^{2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 b^{2}}(x-a)^{2}}$$

The likelihood function is a product of $N$ normal densities, so we can write

$$\begin{aligned}
p(y \mid {\theta}) &=\prod_{n=1}^{N}\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}}\left(y_{n}-\theta\right)^{2}} \\
&=\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{-\frac{N}{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-\theta\right)^{2}}
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, the prior density $p(\theta)$ is given by

$$p(\theta)=\left(2 \pi \tau_{0}^{2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 \tau_{0}^{2}}\left(\theta-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}}$$

Remember the assumption that we made about the distribution for the prior density in the previous section. 

Now, as you would expect from Bayes' theorem, we will combine the prior and likelihood to obtain the posterior distribution. Note that the variable in $p(\theta \mid {y})$ is $\theta$, and we can ignore any constants that do not involve $\theta$.

$$\begin{aligned}
p(\theta \mid {y}) & \propto p(\theta) p({y} \mid \theta) \\
& \propto \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 \tau_{0}^{2}}\left(\theta-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-\theta\right)^{2}} \\
& \propto \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\theta^{2}-2 \theta \mu_{0}}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N \theta^{2}-2 \theta \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)\right] \\
& \propto \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\left(\frac{1}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N}{\sigma^{2}}\right) \theta^{2}-2 \theta\left(\frac{\mu_{0}}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N \bar{y}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)\right)\right]
\end{aligned}$$

where $\bar{y}=N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} y_{n}$ is the sample mean. Since the exponent is quadratic in $\theta$, $p(\theta \mid {y})$ is Gaussian, and we next determine the mean and variance of the distribution.

In this example, the posterior distribution is in the same family as the prior - both are Gaussian. In this case, the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function.

Now, suppose $(\theta \mid {y}) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_1, \tau_{1}^{2}\right)$ for some mean $\mu_{1}$ and variance $\tau_{1}^{2}$. Using the definition of the Gaussian density, we can rewrite the posterior distribution as

$$\begin{aligned}
p(\theta \mid {y}) &=\left(2 \pi \tau_{1}^{2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2 \tau_{1}^{2}}(\theta-\mu_1)^{2}} \\
& \propto \exp {-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\tau^{2}_1} \theta^{2}-2 \theta \frac{\mu_1}{\tau_{1}^{2}}\right)}
\end{aligned}$$

We now have two expressions for the posterior distribution, which are identical for any $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$. The coefficients on $\theta^{2}$ must be the same, in other words we have that 

$$\tau_{1}^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N}{\sigma^{2}}\right)^{-1}$$

Similarily the coefficients on $\theta$ must be the same as well, 

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mu_1}{\tau_{1}^{2}} &=\frac{\mu_{0}}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N \bar{y}}{\sigma^{2}} \\
\mu_{1} &=\tau_{1}^{2}\left(\frac{\mu_{0}}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N \bar{y}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Subtituting the definition of $\tau_{1}^{2}$ into this equation we can write the posterior mean as, 

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu_{1} &=\left(\frac{1}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N}{\sigma^{2}}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{\mu_{0}}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N \bar{y}}{\sigma^{2}}\right) \\
&=\frac{\frac{1}{\tau_{0}^{2}}}{\frac{1}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N}{\sigma^{2}}} \mu_{0}+\frac{\frac{N}{\sigma^{2}}}{\frac{1}{\tau_{0}^{2}}+\frac{N}{\sigma^{2}}} \bar{y}
\end{aligned}$$

If we write the posterior mean as $\omega \bar{y} + (1-\omega) \mu_{0}$ where 

$\omega = \frac{N/\sigma^{2}}{N/\sigma^{2} + 1/\tau_{0}^{2}}$

then we can say that the posterior mean is a weighted average of the data mean and the prior mean. Posterior therefore puts more emphasis on the data when the value of $N$ is large. This is something that we also found in our previous lecture with the Bernoulli distribution.

To make things a bit easier in terms of notation, set $N = 1$. For unknown mean $\theta$ and known variance $\sigma^2$ we have the folowing summary. Some simplifications have been made to make things more readable,   

$$\begin{align*}
    p(y|\theta)&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\theta)^2\right), \quad y \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta,\sigma^2)

Assume $\sigma^2$ known. Remember that model defines likelihood function, 

$$\begin{align*}
      &\text{Likelihood} & p(y|\theta) & \propto
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\theta)^2\right) \\ 
&\text{Prior} & p(\theta) & \propto

& {\exp(a)\exp(b)}  {= \exp(a+b)} \\ \\

&\text{Posterior} & p(\theta|y)& \propto \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{(y-\theta)^2}{\sigma^2}+\frac{(\theta-\mu_0)^2}{\tau_0^2} \right]\right)

\end{align*}$$

Furthermore, we have that, 

$$\begin{align*}
      & &
      p(\theta|y)&\propto \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left[
          \frac{(y-\theta)^2}{\sigma^2}+\frac{(\theta-\mu_0)^2}{\tau_0^2} \right]\right) \\
      & & & \propto \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2\tau_1^2}(\theta-\mu_1)^2
      \right)
\end{align*}$$

$\begin{equation*}
      \theta|y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\tau_1^2), \quad
      \text{where} \quad
      \mu_1=\frac{\frac{1}{\tau_0^2}\mu_0+\frac{1}{\sigma^2}y}{\frac{1}{\tau_0^2}+\frac{1}{\sigma^2}} \quad  \text{and}  \quad \frac{1}{\tau_1^2} = \frac{1}{\tau_0^2}+\frac{1}{\sigma^2}

# ╔═╡ 9e8aa12a-540b-4153-9dbf-8b503c16b091
md" After we have derived (or approximated) a posterior we often want to calculate certain values, such as the mean or variance. Calculating these values normally requires that we compute integrals, like the one below,

$$\mathbb{E}(g(\theta) \mid {y})=\int_{\Theta} g(\theta) p(\theta \mid {y}) \mathrm{d} \theta$$

As an example, if we wanted to calculate the posterior mean we would set $g(\theta) = \theta$ and calculate, 

$$\mathbb{E}(\theta \mid {y})=\int_{\Theta} \theta p(\theta \mid {y}) \mathrm{d} \theta$$

In the case of the posterior variance one would need to have the integral for $g(\theta) = \theta^{2}$. There are cases, such as the coin flipping model, in which these values can be calculated by hand. In general, this integration cannot be solved analytically. However, we can estimate this quantity using Monte Carlo integration. The one prerequisite is that we know how to obtain samples from the posterior. If we are able to sample from the posterior then we generate $S$ draws $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}$ from $p(\theta \mid {y})$, and compute

$$\widehat{g}=\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} g\left(\theta^{(s)}\right)$$

By the weak law of large numbers, $\widehat{g}$ converges weakly in probability to $\mathbb{E}(g(\theta) \mid {y})$ as $S$ tends to infinity. Since we control the simulation size $S$, we can in principle estimate $\mathbb{E}(g(\theta) \mid {y})$ arbitrarily well.

If we wanted to calculate the posterior mean, this would mean that the Monte Carlo approximation is, 

$\hat \theta =\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^{S} \theta^{(s)}$ 

We could do a similar approximation for the variance using the following formula,

$\hat \sigma^{2} =\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} (\theta^{(s)} - \hat \theta)^{2}$ 

Let us show how to calculate these quantities with some code.

md""" 

Please go through this section slowly and make sure you understand everything. I have tried to type out as many of the steps as I could, but perhaps I have skipped some without knowing it.  

Seeing as we now have multiple parameters of interest, we are going to interested in a joint distribution. The joint posterior distribution is given by the following proportional relationship

$$\begin{align*}
      p(\theta_1,\theta_2 \mid y) \propto p(y \mid \theta_1,\theta_2)p(\theta_1,\theta_2)
\end{align*}$$

This joint posterior distribution contains the posterior information about $\mathbf{\theta} = \{\theta_1, \theta_2\}$. Obviously it is going to be difficult to visualise this is we did for the single parameter model. In many instances we are interested in a subset of the parameters, and the other parameters of no real interest to our analysis. These parameters are often referred to as nuisance parameters. The Bayesian solution to this problem is quite natural. We have already established that the posterior is a joint probability distribution, therefore we can simply marginalise out the nuisance parameter through integration. 

Marginalisation entails averaging over the parameter $\theta_2$ to gain access to $\theta_1$, 

$$\begin{align*}
        p(\theta_1 \mid y) = \int p(\theta_1,\theta_2 \mid y) d\theta_2
\end{align*}$$

Using the decomposition $p\left(\theta_{1}, \theta_{2} \mid y\right)=p\left(\theta_{1} \mid \theta_{2}, y\right) p\left(\theta_{2} \mid y\right)$ we can also express this as 

$p\left(\theta_{1} \mid y\right)=\int p\left(\theta_{1} \mid \theta_{2}, y\right) p\left(\theta_{2} \mid y\right) d \theta_{2}$



where $p(\theta_1 \mid y)$ is a marginal distribution. It is a mixture of conditional posterior distributions given the nuisance parameter $\theta_2$. The goal is to find marginal posterior of parameter of interest. We can do this using Monte Carlo approximation.

$$\begin{align*}
      p(\theta_1 \mid y) \approx  \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^{S} p(\theta_1,\theta_2^{(s)}\mid y)
\end{align*}$$

where the $\theta_2^{(s)}$ values are draws from $p(\theta_2 \mid y)$. We can illustrate this with an example using the Gaussian. In the case of the Gaussian we have the following likelihood model

$$\begin{align*}
    p({y} \mid  \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}({ y}-\mu)^2 \right)
\end{align*}$$

We would like to draw from the joint posterior, in other words, we are going to use Monte Carlo methods to draw $\mu^{(s)}, \sigma^{(s)} \sim p(\mu, \sigma  \mid  y)$, where the last part is the joint posterior. We assume that we have a noninformative prior so that $p(\mu,\sigma^2)  \propto \sigma^{-2}$. Note that $p(\mu,\sigma^2)$ is the joint prior here. 

The idea behind the marginalisation concept is depicted in the graph below. Marginal distributions gained from the multivariate normal joint density are depicted below.

Now let us get ready for some math to show what the posterior will look like given our prior choice and the likelihood function provided. This section still needs some work, the notation is not nearly clear enough. However, we will run through the basic logic in class. 

$$\begin{align*}
    & p(\mu,\sigma^2 \mid y) \propto  \sigma^{-2}\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y_i-\mu)^2\right) \\
    &{=  \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\mu)^2\right)}\\
    &{  = \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2+n(\bar{y}-\mu)^2\right]\right)}\\
    &{\color{gray} \text{where } \bar{y}  \color{gray} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i }\\
    &{  = \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left[(n-1)s^2+n(\bar{y}-\mu)^2\right]\right)}\\
    &{\color{gray} \text{where }  s^2  \color{gray} =\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2}
\end{align*}$$

It is useful to know the remember the following trick to complete the derivation. If you have done mathematical statistics you will have seen this before,  


$$\begin{align*}
   &{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\mu)^2}\\
   &{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i^2-2 y_i \mu + \mu^2)}\\
   &{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i^2-2 y_i \mu + \mu^2 -\bar{y}^2 + \bar{y}^2 - 2 y_i \bar{y} + 2 y_i \bar{y})}\\
   &{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i^2-2 y_i \bar{y} + \bar{y}^2) + \sum_{i=1}^n(\mu^2 - 2 y_i \mu -\bar{y}^2  + 2 y_i \bar{y})}\\
   &{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2 + n(\mu^2 -  2\bar{y}\mu -\bar{y}^2  + 2 \bar{y}\bar{y})}\\
   &{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2 + n(\bar{y}-\mu)^2}
\end{align*}$$

We take a look at the marginals since we have a funtional form for the joint posterior (as derived above),

$$\begin{align*}
p(\mu \mid y)  = \int p(\mu,\sigma \mid y) d \sigma \\
       {p(\sigma \mid y)  = \int p(\mu,\sigma \mid y) d \mu }\end{align*}$$

The marginal posterior for $p(\sigma^{2} | y)$ (easier for $\sigma^{2}$ than $\sigma$) is the following, 

$$\begin{align*}
    & {p(\sigma^2 \mid y)} \quad {\propto  \int  p(\mu,\sigma^2 \mid y) d\mu} \\
    &{=\int \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left[(n-1)s^2+n(\bar{y}-\mu)^2\right]\right) d\mu} \\ 
    &{= \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(n-1)s^2\right)} \\
    &{\int \exp\left(-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2}(\bar{y}-\mu)^2\right) d\mu}\\
    &{\color{gray} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(y-\theta)^2\right) d\theta = 1} \\
    &{= \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(n-1)s^2\right)\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2/n}} \\
    &{= (\sigma^2)^{-(n+1)/2}\exp\left(-\frac{(n-1)s^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}
\end{align*}$$

From this we can see that $${p(\sigma^2 \mid y) = \text{Inv}\chi^{2}(\sigma^2 \mid n-1,s^2)}$$. With uninformative prior and unknown mean, 

$$\begin{align*}
      \sigma^2 \mid y  \sim \text{Inv}\chi^{2}(n-1,s^2)\\
      \text{where} \quad s^2 =\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2
  \end{align*}$$

Now we know the marginal distribution for $\sigma$, which means that we can use factorisation of the joint distribution to sample from the joint posterior. The join posterior can be factorised as follows 

$p(\mu,\sigma^2 \mid y) = {\color{darkgreen} p(\mu \mid \sigma^2,y)}{\color{blue} p(\sigma^2 \mid y)}$ 

We have just found the marginal for $\sigma$ as the following, 

${\color{blue} p(\sigma^2 \mid y)}  = \text{Inv}\chi^{2}(\sigma^2 \mid  n-1,s^2)$

This means we can sample from this distribution, 

$(\sigma^2)^{(s)} \sim {\color{blue} p(\sigma^2 \mid y)}$ 

With the variance now known, we know from our previous discussion (Gaussin model with known $\sigma^{2}$ how to sample from the marginal distribution of $\mu$, 

${\color{darkgreen} p(\mu \mid \sigma^2,y)} = \mathcal{N}(\mu \mid \bar{y},\sigma^2/n)\, 
{ \color{gray} {\textstyle \propto \exp\left(-\frac{n}{2\sigma^2}(\bar{y}-\mu)^2\right)}}$

We will then get a sample from this distribution as follows, 

${\mu^{(s)} \sim {\color{darkgreen} p(\mu \mid \sigma^2,y)} }$

In essence we are now done, we can sample from the joint posterior, 

${{\color{red} \mu^{(s)}, \sigma^{(s)}} \sim p(\mu, \sigma  \mid  y)}$

We can write the analytic form of the marginal posterior distribution of $\mu$ here. It is one of the few multiparameter models that is simple enough to solve in closed form.

$$\begin{align*}
     & p(\mu \mid y) =\int_0^\infty p(\mu,\sigma^2 \mid y)d\sigma^2\\
     & { \propto \int_0^\infty \sigma^{-n-2}\exp\left(-{{\color{blue}}\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left[{{\color{blue}}(n-1)s^2+n(\bar{y}-\mu)^2}\right]}\right) d\sigma^2}
\end{align*} $$

Transformation

$$\begin{align*}
     & {A={\color{blue}}(n-1)s^2+n(\mu-\bar{y})^2}{\quad \text{and} \quad {{\color{blue}}z=\frac{A}{2\sigma^2}}} \\
     & {p(\mu \mid y) \propto {{\color{blue}}A^{-n/2}}\int_0^\infty {{\color{blue}}z}^{(n-2)/2}\exp(-{{\color{blue}}z})d{{\color{blue}}z}} \\
& \color{gray} \Gamma(u) = \int_0^\infty x^{u-1}\exp(-x)dx \\
    &{\propto {{\color{blue}}[(n-1)s^2+n(\mu-\bar{y})^2]^{-n/2}}}\\
    &{\propto \left[1+\frac{n(\mu-\bar{y})^2}{(n-1)s^2}\right]^{-n/2}} \\
    &{p(\mu \mid y) = t_{n-1}(\mu \mid \bar{y},s^2/n) \color{gray} \quad \text{Student's $t$}}
\end{align*}$$

Inputting the direct functional forms is labour intensive and it is much easier to simply run our model using a PPL. Below is the code to replicate our model with two unknown parameters. We see that the results coincide with out expectation of the mean and variance.

md" We begin with specfiying a model by using the `@model` macro. Within this model block we can assign variables, either with `~` or `=`. In the first case the variable follows some probability distribution, where in the second case the value is deterministic. 

**Note**: At this stage the notation for the model below does not match up to our derivation, but the idea is right. I just need to relabel things. "
